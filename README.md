We need an application, which can capture the Name, email address, phone no of the visitor and same information also needs to be captured for the host on the front end. At the back end, once the user enters the information in the form, the backend should store all of the information with time stamp of the entry. This should trigger an email and an SMS to the host informing him of the details of the visitor. There should also be a provision of the checkout time which the guest can provide once he leaves. This should trigger an email to the guest with the complete form which should include:

1. Name
2. Phone
3. Check-in time,
4. Check-out time,
5. Host name
6. Address visited.
